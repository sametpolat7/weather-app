# Weather App

This project is a weather application programmed with React and styled with Sass. The data used in the application is provided by two APIs. The first is the 'geoNames API', which is used for the autocomplete feature added to the input tag. This API provides the location names of cities with a population of 5000 or more. The second is the 'Open Meteo API', which provides information for weather and events. This API provides current, daily and weekly weather data.
